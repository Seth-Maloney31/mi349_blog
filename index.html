            <h3>Where History Channel got it wrong</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-10-14">October 14th, 2024</time> Posted By: <span class="author"> MrCoolGuy</span>
            <p class="para1">One of the biggest realisations in my life is that History Channel barely got anything right with their broadcasts.
                I remember watching WWII in Color religiously, and watching it again and again (this is before netflix or any 
                other streaming service was big).  I used to take all of their sayings as fact, I mean, if it's on the History Channel
                then it has to be correct, right?  WRONG.  All of these shows talk about the "Wonder Weapons" that Germany could have
                created, but in reality they were no were near creating anything worth while.  It all just feeds into the myth of 
                German Engineering supposedly being the best.  How many of us grew up thinking that the Panther or King Tiger could
                destroy anything the Allies could throw at it?  Remember that scene in "Fury," where that one Tiger took out two 
                Shermans, and it was made to seem that Brad Pitt and Co. got lucky on killing it?  That was BS.  Fury had a 76mm
                on it, it could have penetrated the Commander's Coupala at the range.  However, that Tiger would have knocked Brad
                Pitt out first since they were making no attempts to hide the upgraded gun.  
            </p>
            <p>Look at this table that I made that shows the Penetration Values for a 76mm Shell (keep in mind that the Tiger had a frontal armor of
                3.9 inches)
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shell</td>
                    <td>Armor pen at 500 yards</td>
                    <td>Armor pen at 1000 yards</td>
                    <td>Armor pen at 1500 yards</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>APC M62</td>
                    <td>3.7 inches</td>
                    <td>3.6 inches</td>
                    <td>3.0 inches</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>AP M79</td>
                    <td>4.3 inches</td>
                    <td>3.6 inches</td>
                    <td>3.0 inches</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>HVAP M93</td>
                    <td>6.2 inches</td>
                    <td>5.3 inches</td>
                    <td>4.6 inches</td>

            <p class="para2">
                I remember wathcing "The Diry Dozen" where the tank commander (forget his name) is talking to Clint Eastwood and 
                he is bragging about how he and his crew put a PVC pipe on their 75mm to make it look bigger and more likely to
                scare the Germans.  Lol, no that's not how it would have gone.  It would have been a giant target on you to the 
                Germans saying that you have a gun that can penetrate their tanks easier.  But good news, it wouldn't have survived
                the first shot through the gun.  PVC tapped to a 75mm gun would have been a fun thing to go soaring through the air 
                as soon as you send one round down range.  Another thing I wish was talked about more was the uselessness of improvised
                armor on tanks.  You've seen it, tanks with sandbags, or in the case of "Fury" tree logs.  You may say, hey it stopped
                the 88mm gun!  In reality it wouldn't have done anything, and it would have only weighted the tank down more.  When we were
                in Syria, the guys were putting water bottles filled with sand inbetween the cage armor with the idea of it defeating shaped
                charges, in reality it wasn't doing anything.
